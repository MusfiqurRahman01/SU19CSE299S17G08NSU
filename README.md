## Project details:

In this project we are going to build a website such as “NSU Parking Registration system” so that user visits this website and do registration in online. User will fill up a form for registration like as parking registration form which will be provided by the website. User will fill up this form and submit it. After submission the authority (security department, parking operator) will verify all data which is given by the user. After verification user receives an email notification for deposit the amount (which is mention in the form section) in the bank (In this case user have to use NSU email account for registration). This website also has a payment section , after verification user can payment parking fees or registration amount which is mention in the registration form.
At this moment if we need to register in NSU parking, we need to fill up registration form manually. That is because we do not have any website for parking registration and payment. After this project is completed, we can do parking registration and payment in online.

## Business plan:

1. Business Concept: We want to develop a software based on the parking automation system. The purpose is to design a system that is easy to register and pay easily without any difficulty for the parking system.
2. Potential: As the current registration system for parking vehicles is manual, our project has great potential to do well.
3. Sales: Every semester, there are a lot of NSU students, staffs, faculties needed to be register for parking .They have to collect form, pay money ,submit it to the chairman for 4 month approval .It takes  a lot of time and work to done. So, we can build a software that can remove all the difficulties .This system can be added on the NSU RDS system or user can pay a small amount to use the software.
