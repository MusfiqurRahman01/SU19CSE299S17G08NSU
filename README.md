## Business plan:

1. Business Concept: We want to develop a software based on the parking automation system. The purpose is to design a system that is easy to register and pay easily without any difficulty for the parking system.
2. Potential: As the current registration system for parking vehicles is manual, our project has great potential to do well.
3. Sales: Every semester, there are a lot of NSU students, staffs, faculties needed to be register for parking .They have to collect form, pay money ,submit it to the chairman for 4 month approval .It takes  a lot of time and work to done. So, we can build a software that can remove all the difficulties .This system can be added on the NSU RDS system or user can pay a small amount to use the software.
